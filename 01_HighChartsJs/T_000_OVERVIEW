In this chapter, we will discuss how to set up the Highcharts library to be used in web application development.

Highcharts requires jQuery as a dependency. First, we will install the jQuery library and then the Highcharts library.

Install jQuery
There are two ways to use jQuery.

Download − Download it locally from jQuery.com and use it.

CDN access − You also have access to a CDN. The CDN will give you access around the world to regional data centers; in this case, Google host. This means using CDN moves the responsibility of hosting files from your own servers to a series of external ones. This also offers an advantage that if the visitor to your webpage has already downloaded a copy of jQuery from the same CDN, it will not have to be re-downloaded.

Using Downloaded jQuery
Include the jQuery JavaScript file in the HTML page using the following script −

<head>
   <script src = "/jquery/jquery.min.js"></script>
</head>
Using CDN
We are using the CDN versions of the jQuery library throughout this tutorial.
Include the jQuery JavaScript file in the HTML page using the following script −

<head>
   <script src = "https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.3/jquery.min.js">
   </script>
</head>
Install Highcharts
The following are the two ways to use Highcharts.

Download − Download it locally from highcharts.com and use it.

CDN access − You also have access to a CDN. The CDN will give you access around the world to regional data centers; in this case, the Highcharts host - Code.Highcharts.Com.

Using Downloaded Highcharts
Include the Highcharts JavaScript file in the HTML page using the following script −

<head>
